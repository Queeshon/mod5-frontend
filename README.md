## CUTE OR BOOT (frontend)

Who has the best aesthetic? With Cute or Boot, users can upload pictures to 'battle' with other users. These battles are head-to-head matches between two users' pictures where all other users can like either picture. The first picture to reach 20 likes wins!

## Concerns and Issues

* Need to fix routes and rendering issues that stem from authentication
* Fix user deletion
* Add battle royale functionality
* Would like to add functionality that allows users to upload a different cute picture upon battle initiation that doesn't destructively edit the user's profile
* Refactoring and cleaning up of code
